# ExcelTableCNN
This repository is for ExcelTableCNN project - open source automatic table detection on Excel sheets with computer vision.

The project's goal is to implement OpenSource library for easy and convenient detection of multiple Table Header/Data coordinates by the use of algorithms combined with Deep Learning/Computer Vision approaches.

## Training Data
For this project the data that's going to be used is based on VEnron2 dataset with markup from [TableSense project](https://github.com/microsoft/TableSense/blob/main/dataset/Table%20range%20annotations.txt).
